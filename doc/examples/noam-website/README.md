## 🖼️ Optimized Profile Photo

The profile photo on my website is optimized using the **AVIF** format for faster loading and better performance, with a fallback to **PNG** for older browsers. The **`<picture>`** element is used to serve the most efficient image format supported by the visitor's browser.

## 🚨 404 Page

I have implemented a **custom 404 page** to handle non-existing URLs on my website. The page is styled using **Tailwind CSS** and ensures users are redirected back to the homepage if they encounter a broken link.

The **404.html** file is located in the **public/** folder, and GitHub Pages automatically serves it when a non-existing route is visited.

👉 **Example:** [https://noamteshuva.com/non-existing-page](https://noamteshuva.com/non-existing-page)
